## About this project

Hi! I am Namish, you may also know me as _chadcat7_.  I always have had a small passion for teaching but because I'm also an introvert, I can't really do that in real life.

<br/>

These are my notes, written by me as I was learning DSA. I am releasing them for free so that other students or enthusiasts can learn from them. I have tried to keep them as simple as possible, but you would need to know the bare minimum of programming concepts to understand them.

<br/>

Most of the "ex-FANG" or "ex-Microsoft ex-Google" employees releasing their courses for thousands of rupees do not go much futher in depth than these notes. So, why waste your money? If you ever have a doubt you can dm me at [@namishdev](https://discord.com/users/715825910611443722) on discord or at [@namishh_](https://x.com/namishh_) on x.

## Before you begin..

If you are a complete beginner, here is a list of things you should do before you start with these notes:

1. Learn the basics of programming languages. And then learn C.
  - [Learning the concepts of programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOjov-2OZ0E)
  - [Learn C in 4 hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87SH2Cn0s9A)
  - After that you can check out my notes on [Pointers](/pre/pointers) and [Memory Management](/pre/memory).
2. Create some basic projects. If you are able to make them with as little help as possible, you are ready to start with these notes.
  - Basic calculator in console
  - Tic-Tac-Toe in console
  - Some management system (bank management, library management, etc.) in the console.
