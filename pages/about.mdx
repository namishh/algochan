## About this project

Hi! I am Namish, you may also know me as _chadcat7_.  I always have had a small passion for teaching but because I'm also an introvert, I can't really do that in real life.

So, I thought why not make my notes available for everyone to see and learn from. These my attempts to make DSA more accessible to the masses, especially the students who are interested.

This is my small effort to stop the students from throwing thousands of their precious money away on way overpriced courses that promise them to get a job at the "BIG TECH".
