## Hello, There! ðŸ‘‹

These are my notes on DSA, written in C, made available for all, for free. This is so that freshers do not have to waste their precious money on way overpriced courses. Contributions are always [welcome](https://github.com/namishh/algochan).

### Prerequisites

These do not cover the topics in the entirety. They are just enough for you to get started with data structures and algorithms. Also, you should be knowing the basics / bare minimum of C.

01.  [Basic Essentials Of Pointers](/pre/pointers)

02.  [Memory Management For Dummies](/pre/memory)

<br/>

### Algorithms

01.  [The O That Is Big (wip)](/algo/big-o)

### Disclaimer
I am not a god in DSA, I am just a student. If you find any mistakes, please let me know. I will be happy to correct them.
