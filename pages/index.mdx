## Hello, There!

<div className="opacity-90">

</div>

These are my notes on DSA, written in C, made available for all, for free. This is so that freshers do not have to waste their precious money on way overpriced books or especially courses. Contributions are always [welcome](https://github.com/namishh/algochan).

### Prerequisites

These do not cover the topics in the entirety. They are just enough for you to get started with data structures and algorithms. Also, you should be knowing the basics / bare minimum of C.

02.  [Memory Management For Dummies](/pre/memory)

### Disclaimer
I am not a god in DSA, I am just a student like you. I am learning and sharing my notes with you. If you find any mistakes, please let me know. I will be happy to correct them.
