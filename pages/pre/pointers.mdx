## Pointers

![pointer](/pointers/pointer.png)

I feel like pointers are very easy to understand, but you need to be skilled to use them effectively. But what

### Exactly is a Pointer?

Pointers are exactly what they are named after. It is something that _points_ to something. In this case, pointers point to a location in memory of some other variable.

Your RAM, the memory has a lot of cells. Let us assume that each cell is of 1 byte. Each cell has an address. The address of the first cell is 0, the second cell is 1, and so on.

When we declare a integer, 4 bytes are allocated to it, for a float, it is also 4 bytes and chars are 1 byte.

```c
int A;
float B;
char C;
```

The above code will look something like this in memory:

```c
A = 5;
```

Now when we assign a value to the variable A, the compiler goes to the lookup table, gets the address of A, which in this case would be 0, and stores the value of 5 in those 4 bytes. Everytime the value of A is called or changed, the compiler goes to the address 0 and does the necessary operations.
<br/>

Let us now introduce pointers.

```c
int *P;
P = &A; // & returns the address of the variable
```

This can also be said as **P is a pointer to an integer**. In the second line, we are assigning the address of A to P. So now, P points to the address of A which in this case is 0.

This is how the memory currently looks like:

Now that we have a pointer, we can do a lot of things with it. But first lets print out the pointer. Predict the output.

```c
printf("%d", P);
printf("%d", *P);
```

```
$ ./main
0
5
```

So we can actually find out the value of A with the notation of *P. This is called **dereferencing a pointer**. Now if we do

```c
*P = 10;
printf("%d", A);
```

```
$ ./main
10
```

We will see that the value of variable A changes.


### Pointers and Maths

We know the value of P is 0. What would be the value of P + 1 ? Well all it does is returns the next availble address for an integer. As the blocks 0 - 3 are already taken by A, the next available address is 4. So the value of P + 1 is 4. Similarly, P + 2 would be 8 and so on.

But what if we tried to print `*(P + 1)`? As we have not allocated any value to the address 4, it would return a garbage value. So it is always better to allocate memory to the address before using it.
