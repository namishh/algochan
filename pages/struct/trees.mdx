This is my first post on any data strcuture. Normally a person would have started with something sane like Linked Lists, but I needed to learn about trees for a project I was working on. So, here we are.
</div>

Trees are a kind of non-linear data structure that is used to store data in a hierarchical manner.

Some of the basic terminologies that would be common for **alls kinds of trees**:

1. **Root**: The topmost node in a tree. In the above example, it is **7**.
2. **Parent**: A node that has children. In the above example, **4** is the parent of of **3** and **9**. Each Root is a parent but not all parents are roots.
3. **Child**: A node that has a parent. In the above example, **3** and **9** are children of **4**.
4. **Leaf / External Node**: A node that has no children. In the above example, **3**, **5** and **9** are leaves.
5. **Siblings**: Nodes that share the same parent. In the above example, **3** and **9** are siblings.
6. **Internal Node**: A single element in a tree that has atleast 1 child. In the above example, **4** is a node.
7. **Depth Of A Node**: Can be defined as the number of branches between the node and the root.
8. **Height Of A Node**: Can be defined as the number of branches between the node and the deepest leaf.
9. **Ancestor**: A node that lies on the path between the root and the node. In the above example, **4** is an ancestor of **3**.
10. **Descendant**: A node that lies on the path between the node and the leaf. In the above example, **3** is a descendant of **4**.
11. **Degree Of A Node**: The number of children a node has.
12. **Degree Of A Tree**: The maximum degree of a node in the tree among all the other nodes.
<br/>
If a tree has **n** nodes, it will have **n-1** edges.

## Binary Trees

<Diagram src="/trees/valid-bintree.png"/>

Binary is a type of tree in which each node has atmost 2 children i.e it has a **degree of 2**. The children are referred to as the **left child** and the **right child**.

The left child is **always smaller than the parent** and the right child is always **greater than the parent**.


### Types Of Binary Trees

<Diagram src="/trees/types-of-binary-trees.png"/>

1. **Full / Strict Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which each node has either 0 or 2 children.

2. **Perfect Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which all the internal nodes have a degree of 2 and all the leaves are at the same level.

3. **Complete Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which all the levels are completely filled except for the last level. The last level is filled from left to right.

4. **Degenerate / Pathological Tree**: A tree in which each parent has only one child. It is basically a linked list.

5. **Skewed Binary Tree**: A tree in which all the nodes have only one child in one specific direction. It is a special case of a degenerate tree.


### Representation Of Binary Trees

The first and the worse way of representing a binary tree is by using arrays. The array is filled from left to right starting from the root. If a node does not have a child, then we will a NULL in its place.

Let us take an example

<Diagram src="/trees/example.png"/>

The array representation of the above tree would be:

```
[6, 2, 3, 4, NULL, 1, 9]
```

But this practice is almost never used because it is very inefficient. The second way of representing a binary tree is by using **linked lists**.

<div className="bg-blue-300/10 my-4 dark:bg-surface-blue/30 border-l-[1px] rounded-r-md border-primary dark:text-primary text-blue-500 text-[16px] p-3">
As of the day of writing this, Sep 2024, I have not yet posted about Linked Lists. But I will soon. So, stay tuned.

### Linked Representation

<Diagram src="/trees/example.png"/>

Let us take the same example as above. Now we will express each node as a structure with 3 things, the value, the **address** of the left node and **the  address** of the right node.

```c
// If you already know some DSA
// you might find this similar to a doubly linked list.
struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* left;
    struct Node* right;
};
```

The linked representation of the above tree wouuld look like

<Diagram src="/trees/linked-representation.png"/>

So let us define a very basic binary tree in C.

```c
struct Node *root;
root = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node)); // Allocating memory for the root node
root->data = 6;
root->left = NULL;
root->right = NULL;
```

Here we have the most basic of a binary tree which has only 1 node (the root). If you did not understand what I did in the second line, please refer to my post on [Dynamic Memory Allocation](/pre/memory).

Now let us add some more nodes to extend this root

```c
struct Node *p1, *p2;
p1 = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
p2 = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));

p1->data = 2;
p1->left = NULL;
p1->right = NULL;

p2->data = 3;
p2->left = NULL;
p2->right = NULL;
```

Now we can attach these newly created nodes to the root

```c
root->left = p1;
root->right = p2;
```
