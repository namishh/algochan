# Recursion

<Diagram src="/recursion/recursion.png" />

Recursion might be one of the **most important concepts** in the field of DSA. Without that, you cannot do **graphs**, **trees**, **backtracking**, **divide and conquer**, etc. At first, it feels useless, it feels as if using loops is better. But as you progress, you will see that recursion is a very powerful tool.

You need to know about the following topics before starting this

1. Functions
2. [Memory Management](/pre/memory)

Let us start with this code

```c
void print_three() {
    printf("3\n");
}

void print_two() {
    printf("2\n");
    print_three();
}

void print_one() {
    printf("1\n");
    print_two();
}

int main() {
    print_one();
    return 0;
}
```

Well, this will obviously print `1 2 3`. But from previous notes, we know that each function makes a stack frame and it will be their as long as the function is running. So, when **print_one calls print_two**, the stack frame of **print_one** is still there, same with **print_two** when it calls **print_three**. But this code is obviously bad, so us use recursion to make it better.

```c
void print(int n) {
    printf("%d\n", n);
    print(n + 1);
}

int main() {
    print(1);
    return 0;
}
```

Effective, what now happens in that when `print` is called, it will print the number and then create another stackframe for itself but with the argument `n + 1`. But this program does not know when to stop printing, hence it will print numbers infinitely. This is called **infinite recursion**.
<br/>

We need to have an condition to stop the recursion. This is called the **base case**. Let us modify the code to have a base case.

```c
void print(int n) {
    if (n > 3) {
        return;
    }
    printf("%d\n", n);
    print(n + 1);
}

int main() {
    print(1);
    return 0;
}
```

Now this code checks if the number is greater than or equal to 3, if it is, it will return and the recursion will stop. Now, this will print

```
1
2
3
```

Well these were the basics of recursion.

### Factorial
The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number. **The factorial of 0 is 1**.
Mathematically

<div align="center">
$ F(n) = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2)  ... \times  2 \times 1 $
</div>

The base case here would be that n is less than or equal to 1, in which case we return 1.

```c
int factorial(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return 1;
    }
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
```

### Fibonacci Series

The **Fibonacci Series** is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. Let us write a function to get the **nth Fibonacci number**.

The basic idea is that

<div align="center">
$ F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2) $
</div>

Visualizing `F(2)`, we get

<Diagram src="/recursion/fibo-recursion.png" />

The base case for this is that if **n** is less than or equal to 1, we return **n**.


```c
int fibo(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return n;
    }
    return fibo(n - 1) + fibo(n - 2);
}
```
