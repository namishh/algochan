title: Why are you here?
---
## Dear traveller

You, are lost. Somehow you are very very lost. What are you doing here? You are NOT supposed to be here. You should [go back and study](/) or... you can stay here and [read random stuff](https://namishh.me/blog) or [some poetry](https://namishh.me/poems). I mean, you are already here, right? So why not?

It is not like you have anything better to do. You are lost after all.
